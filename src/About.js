        <h1>A Culture of Good Health</h1>
        <h4><strong>From the Chairman and CEO Desk</strong></h4>
        <p>Omair was founded with a vision of correcting our broken health delivery system where it matters most- at the entry level of care, which is “Primary Care” It encompasses a huge area at pre-hospital space right from care at home to responding to day to day health care needs. This could be acute and chronic illnesses to more urgent and emergency medical situations.</p>
        <p>The all important Preventive care can only be dispensed and monitored effectively at a robust Primary Care System. A large section of our population working in Industrial complexes and Corporate Houses which are growing, need a robust Preventive Occupational Health care service and Industrial Hygiene at their on-site modern clinics.
</p>
<p>
It is our endeavour to have a chain of high quality Health Centres with all the services required to bridge the huge gap that exists at present in people’s health care needs. Each Healthspring Centre in the location brings all the health care services under one roof- for individual, family, community, corporate houses and Industrial complexes.
</p>
<p>At Healthspring, we are committed to a culture of good health.
